# Getting Started

Orbital Mechanics is a topic that requires little introduction. Built on the very much basic principles of Maths and Physics, Orbital Mechanics concerns the motion of objects in orbit. This is an incredibly important topic to master, and you need basic knowledge of vectors and Newton's Laws. After all, who else to learn from than the first person to come up with a logical equation for Universal Gravitation, which was unfortunately wrong?
